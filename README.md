**Shipxy MCP Server** is a fully MCP-compliant, open-source Location-Based Service (LBS) solution for maritime scenarios, providing a comprehensive suite of ship and port APIs and tools for developers and AI agents. It enables seamless integration of real-time vessel data, route planning, weather, tides, and more into your applications.

## 🚀 Introduction

**Shipxy MCP Server** empowers your applications, LLMs, and agents with advanced maritime data and geospatial intelligence, including:

- **Ship Information & Tracking:** Real-time vessel position, static info, fleet, and area queries.
- **Port & Berth Data:** Global port search, berth/anchor/ETA queries, port call records.
- **Route Planning:** Point-to-point and port-to-port route planning.
- **Weather & Tides:** Marine weather, typhoon, and tide station data.
- **Rich Maritime APIs:** Ship registry, particulars, approach events, and more.

All APIs follow the MCP protocol and can be called from any MCP-compliant client, LLM, or agent platform.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Full MCP Protocol Support:** Seamless integration with any MCP-compliant agent, LLM, or platform.
- **Comprehensive Maritime Data:** Ships, ports, routes, weather, tides, and more.
- **Real-Time & Historical Data:** Live vessel tracking, voyage history, and event records.
- **Open Source & Extensible:** MIT licensed, easy to customize and extend.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Get Your API Key

Register and create a server-side API Key at [Shipxy Open Platform](https://api.shipxy.com/v3/console/overview).  
**Note:** The API key is required for all requests.

### 2. Installation

Install from PyPI after release:

```bash
pipx install mcp-shipxy-api
```

Or install into an existing virtual environment:

```bash
pip install mcp-shipxy-api
```

For local source development:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### 3. Configuration

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```
SHIPXY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 4. Start the Server

Recommended: Use an `mcp.json` configuration file for easy integration with MCP CLI and agent platforms. Example:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shipxy-api-mcp": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/path/to/your/server.py"],
      "env": {
        "SHIPXY_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## CLI Usage

This project also provides a cross-platform CLI. Business commands stay flat and map directly to MCP tool names, with underscores converted to dashes:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .

shipxy auth status
shipxy tools
shipxy schema search-ship
shipxy search-ship COSCO --max 5
shipxy get-single-ship 413211000
shipxy search-port Shanghai
shipxy plan-route-by-port CNSHA SGSIN
shipxy get-weather-by-point --lng 123.58414 --lat 27.37979
```

Windows PowerShell activation:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

The CLI defaults to JSON output for LLM and agent calls. For human-readable output:

```bash
shipxy search-ship COSCO --max 5 --format table
shipxy search-ship COSCO --max 5 --format pretty
shipxy search-ship COSCO --max 5 --format ndjson
```

You can also start the MCP server through the CLI:

```bash
shipxy mcp start
shipxy mcp start --transport sse --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Agent and MCP clients should configure the API key through the `SHIPXY_API_KEY` environment variable:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shipxy": {
      "command": "shipxy",
      "args": ["mcp", "start"],
      "env": {
        "SHIPXY_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
